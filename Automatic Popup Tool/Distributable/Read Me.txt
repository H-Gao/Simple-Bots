=================================================================

To use the program run start.bat, after modifying the input.txt file.

The first input is the amount of times the tabs will run.
Values of over 200 will be laggy, values over 2,000 will likely crash the browser. Anything over is overkill.

The second input is the website it will be directed to.
Do not type in the protocol: Ex. Type in www.google.com or www.cats.com.
